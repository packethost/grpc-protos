# Packet's Shared GRPC Repo

## Layout

This repo is meant to be used as a submodule.
The preferred location is $gitroot/grpc/protos.
The generated files should be located in $gitroot/grpc/gen.

The Go Makefile expects this layout, it would be nice of Ruby and other languages could follow along if possible.
